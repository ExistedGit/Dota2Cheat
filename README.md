There weren't many open-source Dota cheats. And so I decided to fix that.
Written in C++20 with love

Some SDK bits were fully or partionally taken from [McDota](https://github.com/LWSS/McDota) by LWSS, which D2C was inspired by.

Using [ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) with DirectX 11 for the interface

also using [Minhook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook) for them trampolines

also using Google's [Protocol Buffers](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) for net message handling

Cheers to their wonderful creators!

As of late I'm largely disinterested in developing D2C, in part due to "skinchanger depression", as I'd call it.

## Building
You need to install the protobuf library for it to work. Install [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html). Navigate to the folder with vcpkg.exe. Open the console in the folder and enter the following command:

`.\vcpkg.exe install protobuf:x64-windows-static-md`

This will install the heavier static version of the library. 

Once the process completes, go to `installed/x64-windows-static-md`. Copy libprotobuf.lib and libprotobuf-lite.lib files from /lib to Dota2Cheat/lib. You can also copy the libs with a `d` suffix from debug/lib if you want to compile it in Debug

You also need to install the [June 2010 DirectX SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812)

Open the project in Visual Studio and build Dota2Cheat as **Release x64**

## Injecting
This cheat can be safely reinjected at any point of the game

Build & run D2CInstaller to move all relevant resources to their destination in %User%\Documents\Dota2Cheat, then use any injector to do the job.

**Use at own risk, absolutely not UD** (also consider not using non-legit features that you can get reported/flagged for)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter an error and want to coherently report it:

### Debugging

This method is for errors that are easily reproducible. You're meant to be playing either in the demo mode or a lobby(not on a VAC-protected server!)
Build both the cheat and loader in Debug. Launch dota 2, then In Visual Studio Ctrl + Alt + P and select dota2.exe.
Now that you're debugging the process, inject the cheat and trigger the error. VS will show you where the exception occurs.

### What to do when an error appears

Upon an exception, examine the file and lines it happened on. In the Call Stack tab you'll be able to trace the call to the function(in case the exception place doesn't provide enough information). Screenshot all of this and then you can make an Issue here with the data.

# For Developers

Check out the repo's Wiki, I add useful pieces of information about dota-specific cheat things there

Also has a guide on how to update it

AND I also consider translating my YouGame tutorials to a human language for the sake of preservation
